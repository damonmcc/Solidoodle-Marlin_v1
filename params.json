{"name":"Solidoodle-marlin v1","tagline":"Reprap FW with look ahead. SDcard and LCD support. It works on Gen6, Ultimaker, RAMPS and Sanguinololu","body":"#Marlin firmware for Solidoodle 2\r\n\r\nPrevious official Solidoodle firmware was based on early version of Marlin and could not be altered to accomodate a Panelolu LCD screen and encoder without many errors. This version has configuration.h and configuration_adv.h altered to reflect all changes found in official Solidoodle firmware.\r\n\r\n##Step 1\r\n\r\nYou need to have the Arduino0022 IDE installed. If you have a later version, you'll need to downgrade.\r\n\r\nDownload from:\r\n\r\n-http://arduino.cc/hu/Main/Software\r\n\r\n###PC Users:\r\n\r\nA version of Arduino022 already setup for this firmware is now available again at: http://www.mediafire.com/?3qy0wjf86a66du8\r\n\r\nSimply unzip into a folder of your choice.\r\nSkip to step 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Step 2 (Mac only)\r\n\r\nClone the repository at\r\n\r\n-https://github.com/jmgiacalone/sanguino1284p\r\n\r\nand copy the included Sanguino directory to the hardware directory of your Arduino install. On Mac OS X, that would be ~/Documents/Arduino/hardware.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Step 3 (Mac only)\r\n\r\nClose the Arduino IDE and then copy the file avrdude.conf from the sanguino1284p clone to your ~/Documents/Arduino/hardware/tools/avr/etc.\r\n\r\nStart the Arduino IDE and you should now see 'Sanguino W/ ATmega644P' AND 'Sanguino W/ ATmega1284P' options in the Tools->Board menu.\r\n\r\n##Step 4\r\n\r\nIf you have a Solidoodle 2, then the firmware is already setup for you by default.\r\n\r\nIf you have a Solidodle 3, simply change line 15 in configuration.h from:\r\n\r\n```C\r\n#define SOLIDOODLE_VERSION 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nto:\r\n\r\n```C\r\n#define SOLIDOODLE_VERSION 3 \r\n```\r\n\r\n##Step 5\r\n\r\nFor the standard Solidoodle 2/3 model with the 644P microcontroller, upload the firmware as is and select the 'Sanguino W/ ATmega644P' option.\r\n\r\n##Step 6\r\n\r\nIf you're adding an SDSL SDCARD reader, or Panelolu LCD display and rotary encoder with SDSL, you will need to select the 'Sanguino W/ ATmega1284P' board. Please purchase a 1284P with a bootloader already in place.\r\n\r\nFor a Panelolu/SD card reader combo, uncomment line 316 in configuration.h from:\r\n\r\n```C\r\n//#define ULTIPANEL  //the ultipanel as on thingiverse\r\n```\r\nto:\r\n```C\r\n#define ULTIPANEL  //the ultipanel as on thingiverse\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow compile and upload.\r\n\r\n-http://www.soliforum.com/topic/127/panelolu-complete-guide/\r\n\r\n-http://www.emakershop.com/browse/listing?l=280\r\n\r\n-http://www.emakershop.com/browse/listing?l=307\r\n\r\n-http://blog.think3dprint3d.com/2012/06/panelolu-in-depth.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're only adding SDSL, uncomment line 313 in configuration.h from:\r\n\r\n```C\r\n//#define SDSUPPORT // Enable SD Card Support in Hardware Console\r\n```\r\nto:\r\n```C\r\n#define SDSUPPORT // Enable SD Card Support in Hardware Console\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow compile and upload.\r\n\r\n-http://reprap.org/wiki/SDSL\r\n\r\n-http://www.emakershop.com/browse/listing?l=182\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
